# E-voting

The Task
You are required to work on the development of a large, complex application. 

You should also evaluate the impact the OO approach, design principles and patterns has had on that development process 
â€“ identifying which OO features, design principles and patterns and explaining where and why they were applied and evaluating the effectiveness of those OO features and principles (if appropriate comparing/contrasting the implementation features with those of other programming languages).

Case Study
Electronic voting systems offer a number of potential benefits during elections. They can improve the speed of vote counting, reduce the cost of running elections, improve accessibility and potentially offer improvements in security and auditing over existing paper-based voting systems. However, they also raise issues around voter identification, privacy and security. SBMM wish to create an e-voting system which they can sell to countries around the world. 
From research and discussions with existing providers of voting services, SBMM have determined that they require a system that is flexible enough to support a variety of voting mechanisms/electoral systems (such as single transferable vote, first-past-the-post, preferential voting, etc.), as there is no international standard method for voting.

They also want the system to allow for both in-person (voting booth) and remote (online) voting, as it is felt that this will extend the possible markets for the system. Due to worries about issues such as privacy and security, they require a system that is robust and ideally follows existing standards and/or meets legislation around these issues (such as GDPR). They must also be able to demonstrate that the system is usable by a variety of users, in different countries and with different languages. 
Note that this description of the desired system is not exhaustive, and part of this stage of bidding includes researching potential requirements and features of e-voting systems to maximise the utility of the system around the world. Your choice of features (and the justification of these choices) are an integral part of the design process.
